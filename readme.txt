== Description ==

WordPress plugin for easily adding CSS stylesheets & JavaScript files.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

The main stylesheet & JavaScript external script can be set in Appearances -> Theme -> Directories. There is also a checkbox for turning off jQuery, which WordPress automatically loads.

Individual pages can have specific stylesheet or JavaScript external scripts added in input boxes on those pages' individual editor pages.

Beyond this, stylesheets & javascript files can be loaded manually in PHP by calling the "register" static method on the WPStylesheets or WPScripts classes. The WPScripts' register method includes an optional boolean 2nd argument to determine whether the script should be loaded in the footer or the header. Default is loading in the footer. "dequeueWPDefaults" static method for the WPScripts class can be used to turn off jQuery in PHP.


== Examples ==

	use WaughJ\WPScripts\WPStylesheets;
	WPStylesheets::register( 'main' );

	use WaughJ\WPScripts\WPScripts;
	WPScripts::register( 'blog', true );
